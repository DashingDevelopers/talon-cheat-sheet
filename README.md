#Talon Voice Commands Cheatsheet


1. Have talon installed and running on your computer following the instructions at [talonvoice.com](https://talonvoice.com/docs/index.html#getting-started)
2. Have this repo cloned  into the user directory of ~/talon.  This makes these scripts available to talon.
3. Say "print cheatsheet" or Open the talon repl and type

```
actions.user.cheatsheet()
```

Then open the cheatsheet.html file in your browser.  You can also print it to have a hard copy.
The HTML includes page breaks, so it should come out fairly nicely.

Suggested Future features:

Add a way to print a  cheat sheet from a single user context to cater for new user Repositories and applications.
It might just be easier to generate individual HTML files per thing. So that No configuration is required.
Alternatively you can just the file in the word processor,  and edit out the bits you don't need updating.

Feel free to contribute to this repo.  I will be happy to accept pull requests.
